String extension
================

This extension provides a wrapper around char* strings, providing a number of useful operators.  
The purpose of this extension is to provide a simple demo of operator overloading.  

Operators include
* String append: s1 + s2
* String repeat: s * i
* String remove-all-occurences: s1 - s2
* String equality: s1 == s2
* String assignment from most builtin types: s1 = x
* To string operator: tostring(x)
