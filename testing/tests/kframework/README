Files in testing/tests/kframework/ were pulled from

https://code.google.com/p/c-semantics/

on 2013-7-31. The zip file provided split the tests between allgood and allbad.
The allgood tests are copied into the positive/ directory, and the allbad tests
are copied into the negative/ directory. The negative files appear to be
related to the Excel file, which has been copied into the kframework/
directory for further investigation.
