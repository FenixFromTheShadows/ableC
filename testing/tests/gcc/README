The five directories in ableC/testing/tests/gcc are as follows:

assemble
* These tests have the dg-assemble flag and nothing else (no warnings, errors, etc)
* Should be assembled, no more
* ...not sure what happens if anything beyond assembling is done

compile
* These tests have the dg-compile flag
* compile/negative/ contains tests with dg-error flags
* compile/positive/ may contain tests with dg-warning or dg-message flags

default
* Contain zero dg-* flags. 
* Some .h files required in other directories may be found here
* Runnable?

link
* Just like assemble, these tests have the dg-link flag and nothing else
* Should be linked, no more
* ...not sure what happens if anything beyond linking is done

run
* Contain only dg-run flags
* Should be run
